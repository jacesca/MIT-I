    "* [Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-autocorrelation-partial-autocorrelation/): This article talks about the concept of ACF and PACF for time series analysis and their intuition in AR and MA models with Python implementation.\n",
    "* [AR, MA, and ARMA models](http://www.blackarbs.com/blog/time-series-analysis-in-python-linear-models-to-garch/11/1/2016): This article talks about the various kinds of models used in time series forecasting such as AR, MA, ARMA, etc., with python implementation. The article also includes some advanced models for time series analysis that are out of the scope of this lecture (such as ARCH, GARCH). Interested learners can explore them but they are not part of the lecture.\n",
